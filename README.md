AllCare is an application that provides quick and easy access to patient symptoms with conditions and appointment times along with effective communication with his or hers physicians. Our application focuses on simplicity. Our program must be user-friendly due to the possibility of our users not being “tech-savvy” and the age range. A patient will first enter their name and their symptoms. They will then be prompted to enter an appointment time best for their schedule and the physician. This program will enable the patient to change and or delete their scheduled appointments. 
 
We used two data sets to derive the information for our program. Our program needed to address the issues that those living in rural communities face. We used the Mississippi Geospatial Data Catalog as one of our data sets. We use this data set because it was essential for us to address the point that the vast geographic area between residents and a local physician or hospital has adverse effects on the health outcomes of individuals. We could further prove this idea by using the World Health Organization dataset. This data set further demonstrates how geographic areas could affect health outcomes. It provides us with other health statistics associated with residents living in rural communities. 

The Data Structures used include a linked list and a do while loop.  The program will provide the user with a menu of options that they are looking for pertaining to their account or desires. If a user desires to add a symptom, they will be prompted to provide their name, appointment time, and then allowed the option to add their symptoms. Users also can save and delete their files whenever they desire. The program also offered the capabilities of changing appointment times. These functions can be achieved by simply pressing the number corresponding to the function the user selects.
